Learning and Projects in Java

Here you can find all my Java Learnings and Code that i practice. I am still a newby in Java and am open to any feedbacks.

This project has been prepared to target Java 21 (latest LTS). A minimal `pom.xml` was added so you can build with Maven using Java 21.

Next steps:
- Install JDK 21 on your machine (or configure your IDE/toolchain to use Java 21).
- Run `mvn -v` to verify Maven and Java installation, then `mvn package` to compile.
